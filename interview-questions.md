# ASSESSMENT 4: Interview Practice Questions
Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.  

1. Are Ruby methods accessors or mutators?

  Your answer:I'm not sure if this was some sort of trick question or not because from what I can remember is that they can either be accessors and mutators.

  Researched answer: A mutator method is a method used to control changes to a variable. They are also widely known as setter methods. Often a setter is accompanied by a getter (also known as an accessor), which returns the value of the private member variable.



2. What is a block in Ruby?

  Your answer: A block is a way of grouping statements.

  Researched answer:A Ruby block is a way of grouping statements, and may appear only in the source adjacent to a method call, the block is written starting on the same line as the method call's last parameter (or the closing parenthesis of the parameter list) The Ruby standard is to use braces for single-line blocks and do.



3. Ruby has an implicit return. What does that mean?

  Your answer: An implicit return is a return is not explicitly called upon.

  Researched answer:Any statement in Ruby returns the value of the last evaluated expression. A simple example is the getter method.But as we know, Ruby always returns the last evaluated expression.



4. What is object-oriented programming? How is it different than functional programming?

  Your answer: Object oriented programming is when data is stored in objects. They're different because functional programming data can't be stored in objects.

  Researched answer:Both Functional programming and object-oriented programming uses a different method for storing and manipulating the data. In functional programming, data cannot be stored in objects and it can only be transformed by creating functions. In object-oriented programming, data is stored in objects.



5. What is the difference between a class and an object?

  Your answer: The difference between a class and an object is that a class is a template for an object, and an object is a state where all the properties have values.

  Researched answer:The difference is simple and conceptual. A class is a template for objects. An object is a member or an "instance" of a class. An object has a state in which all of its properties have values that you either explicitly define or that are defined by default settings.



6. STRETCH: What is Duck Typing?

  Your answer: I'm not necessarily sure what duck typing is, I don't really have a clue.

  Researched answer:Duck typing in computer programming is an application of the duck test, to determine if an object can be used for a particular purpose.
